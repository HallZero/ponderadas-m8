This is Kento Namami, a former office worker. Please don't call me that again. Many Jujutsu sorcerers are weird, but thanks to his office time, he's very responsible. And a first-rate sorcerer. I'm sure the others don't want to hear you talking about them. Oh, I see. And dark glasses. How trendy, huh? But explain something to me. Why didn't you become a sorcerer from the beginning? First, greetings. Pleasure to meet you, Yuji Itadori. Oh, yes. The pleasure is all mine. One thing I learned after I studied Jujutsu... is that normal work is a stupid thing. Huh? And then, what I learned working at a normal office... is that normal work is a stupid thing. Oh, you're kidding. And if both things are stupid, I chose what worked best for me. That was the only reason I came back. How sad. Yeah. Itadori, please don't imagine that Satoru and I think the same way.
